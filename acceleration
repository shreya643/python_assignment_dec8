#We have v=u+at where v is velocity, u is initial velocity, and t is time. And value for each is as follows: v=25m/s. u=0m/s, t=10 seconds.
# Find the acceleration a. [Rearrange the equation, also use proper formatting syntax while displaying the answer.]

v=25
u=0
t=10

a=(v-u)/t

print("\nThe acceleration(a)=(v-u)/t\n\t\t\t\t=({}-{})/{}\n\t\t\t\t={}".format(v,u,t,a))
